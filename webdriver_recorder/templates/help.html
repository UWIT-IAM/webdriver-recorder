    <h5>Test Summary</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on any test title to expand or collapse its details</li>
        <li>Click the <i class="bi-bookmark text-primary"></i>
            bookmark icon to copy a shareable link to your clipboard.</li>
        <li>
            Click the <i class="bi-file-earmark-code text-primary"></i>
            code icon to copy the test ID to your clipboard. (Useful for
            re-running tests.)
        </li>
        <li>The <i class="bi-check-circle text-success"></i> success icon
            indicates the test succeeded.</li>
        <li>The <i class="bi-exclamation-circle text-danger"></i>
            failure icon indicates the test failed. This may be due to a failed
            assertion, or an error running the test.
        </li>
        <li>If any tests failed, you can view them easily using the "Show
            only failures" toggle at the top of the report.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Test Details</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>When test details are expanded, all screenshots are rendered as
            thumbnails. Click on an image to open it in a new tab; you can also now
            share image URLs for reports stored accessed through identity-artifact</li>
        <li>Along with thumbnails, you will usually find captions
            that were set automatically, or by the test implementer, to help
            narrate the storyboard.</li>
        <li>Context messages that appear in
            <span class="text-danger">red</span> indicate that the screenshot
            was taken after an error was encountered, and will also include the
            type of error received. A <code>TimeoutException</code> indicates that
            an expected element was never rendered.
        </li>
        <li>If a test is marked as failed, its browser logs and error tracebacks
            will be viewable in a separate overlay (like this one). Keep in
            mind that browser logs may show errors that do <em>not</em> have
            anything to do with the failure. (For instance, failed asynchronous
            requests that were expected to fail.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Report data:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the "View as JSON" link to view the raw report data. This can
            allow you to analyze or create supplementary reports of tests and
            test histories, provided you have the links to other report JSON
            documents.</li>
        <li>It is also possible to generate a different report using the same
            data. See
            <a href="https://www.github.com/uwit-iam/webdriver-recorder/blob/main/docs/templating.md"
